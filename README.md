# Dynamic-Menu
In this repository we speak how to create a dynamic menu with coming data from DataBase or static array using recursion.
And 'useful for those who want to create the dynamic menu having a certain number of children without creating duplicate code.
It will include two directives, one page html and css files.

This repository I created it by combining the two guides:
The guide of the directive that generates the dynamic menu recursive and guidance as reppresentazione dynamic menu graphics to avoid duplicate HTML code.

I created two different resolutions:
The solution 1 is with the shared scope (generates all from father to son). In this case working with Rest services (JSON file)
The solution 2 is with the scope isolated with scope: '='
